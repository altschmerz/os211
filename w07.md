# Top 10 List of Week 07

1. [Race Conditions and How to Prevent Them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqnpIwN7dz0)

    An explanation video doesn't get any better than with 2 adorable bots illustration. Those adorable bots successfully kept my attention throughout the video. The video explores briefly about race condition in general. It starts from mutual exclusion, to signaling, and then it also proceeds to explain about Dekker's Algorithm, which is quite interesting, in my opinion.

2. [Race Condition Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zyYjlaEY1k)

    Albeit being only 40 seconds long, this video, I must say, is highly entertaining (at least for me). The video shows several people acting, trying to illustrate a race condition in real life scenarios. I think the awkward laughs and hesitant stares between the acts just made this video 10 times better.

3. [Dining Philosophers Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbwbQQB7xNQ)

    What initially caught my attention to this video is the title. I've never heard of this problem before, and it sounds kinda fun, so I decided to give it a watch (well turns out it's a classic problem). The Dining Problem illustrates an example of a deadlock problem: a number of philosophers trying to eat, but can only do so while having both forks. Beside the problem, this video also explains the solution near the end of it.

4. [Process Synchronisation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKKc0d7kzww)

    As its title suggests, this video covers the general idea of process synchronization. It gives a case example with illustrations of threads as people trying to access the critical section. Also, after the example, it proeeds to explain the flow more clearly in diagram form, which makes it much easier to understand.

5. [Deadlock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVo9mGARkhQ)

    This video, as you've probably guessed by now, is about deadlocks. It covers deadlock definitions, the 4 conditions that result in deadlock, and also dealock handling methods. There's this one example it provides, the traffic problem, which I think is a very simple and intuitive example of deadlock. Beside that, it even provides a summary of the materials covered in the description section, which is quite helpful I suppose, to review what we've learned from the video.

6. [What Is a Semaphore? How Do They Work?](youtube.com/watch?v=ukM_zzrIeXs)

    This video explains about Semaphore. It covers what Semaphore is, what it does, why we use it, and how it actually works. It also provides plenty of illustrations and examples in C. The explanation are delivered clearly and in a fairly simple manner that makes the materials easy to grasp.

7. [Semaphores Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQ5aK5wLCQE)

    This is an illustration video in regards to Semaphore. The video attempts to illustrate Semaphore in the scenario of a restaurant. So there's a security guard who tracks open seats at the restaurant. This security guard is said to play the role of Semaphore. He only lets customers in if there are seats available. Otherwise, the customers will have to wait outside the restaurant. I figure the illustrations helped me in better understanding how Semaphore works, given the very intuitive and relatable illustration.

8. [Banker's Algorithm Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0FXvTHcYi4)

    This video gives an example of Banker's Algorithm. It not only illustrates, but also walk us through step by step of the example in detail, which in result, helps me so much better in understanding the algorithm, since I get to see in detail what each step does and how it contributes to the algorithm execution as whole.

9. [Banker's Algorithm for Deadlock Avoidance | An Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V2FfP_olaA)

    This 4 minutes long video provides another example of Banker's Algorithm in usage. After tackling the basis and the details of the step with the video on the previous number, I can safely get into this video. This video walks through the steps more quickly, not in as much detail as the previous video, but since I've got it covered, it's all good.

10. [Reader - Writer Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vfZhdTgA5A)

    The Reader-Writer Problem is another classical problems regarding process synchronization. This video covers the topic in a very great way: providing illustrations and clear explanation with simple, easy to understand words.
