# Top 10 List of Week 03

1. [Files & File Systems: Crash Course Computer Science #20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN8YgJnShPM&t=157s)

    I'm gonna start off this week's list with another Crash Course video, this time about file systems, of course. This video begins with explanation on some file formats like txt, wav, and bmp, and how data are structured in each format. After that, it covers storage and file system, how files are stored, what happens when we edit or delete them, etc.

2. [NTFS vs FAT32 vs exFAT - Everything You Need To Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsP_sBUbmZM&t=213s)

    As the title suggested, this video covers the basics of each NTFS, FAT32, and exFAT, together with each type's variations. Then it compares the three as to which one we should use given certain circumstances.

3. [File Allocation Methods in OS](https://exploringbits.com/file-allocation-methods-in-operating-system/)

    I was trying to search up a video on this subject on YouTube, but none of the videos helped much, so I had to resort to readable resource. Luckily, I found this page. What made this page different than the other is really only in the material serving method. It serves the information in pictures, sectioned in such a way that it's easier to read and grasp instead of just cramming in a bunch of long texts like most other sites.

4. [Absolute and Relative Paths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ephId3mYu9o&t=28s)

    The video provides exactly what it states: explanation about absolute and relative paths, no bs. It's only 2 minutes long, but still pretty insightful and delivered clearly.

5. [File Access Methods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aruUAN9lYU4&t=9s)

    File access methods, simple explanation of how they work, and their drawbacks. This video covers quite basic things, plus the illustrations stuffs make it much easier to understand.

6. [What are Drive Partitions?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeUM4kR67XQ&t=6s)

    This is a video on drive partitions, what they are, why we need them, what difference they make, etc. It also covers the disadvantage of partitioning, and what factors we should consider first before deciding to partition or not to partition.

7. [Compression: Crash Course Computer Science #21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtDxDvCpPL4&t=49s)

    I've certainly come across the term compression many times, but never really understand what exactly it is, what it does, what it's used for. Well, this video helped shed light on it for me. 

8. [TarBall](https://wiki.debian.org/TarBall)

    When first given this week's assignment, I had absolutely zero idea what a tarball is. So eventually, I'll have to look it up, and this is one of the many websites I found that helped me understand what it actually is.

9. [File Organization](https://scc.ustc.edu.cn/zlsc/sugon/intel/compiler_f/main_for/bldaps_for/common/bldaps_fileorg.htm)

    This website covers file organization, what it is and the two types of it. It also proceeds to explain each of the type. The explanation wasn't too deep, but not too shallow either, just right to get me prepared on basic file organization knowledge.

10. [File-System Implementation](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/12_FileSystemImplementation.html)

    The materials provided in this page is referred from Operating System Concepts by Silberchatz et al., I guess this is a summarized version of the materials from the book. It's pretty in-depth and has pictured added in each section which personally helped me a lot in understanding them.
