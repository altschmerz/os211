# TIPS ON OS CLASS

1. The scoring system for this course at the moment is via assignemts. We have 11 assignments, each weighing 11.11 points maximum. The score will be taken from 9 assignments with highest scores. So the maximum score you can get in this course would be 9*11.11 = 99.99. Try scoring as high as possible in the early weeks, as assignments are much easier at those time :)
