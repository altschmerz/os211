# Top 10 List of Week 02

1. [Hashing Algorithms and Security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4b8ktEV4Bg&t=28s)

   An 8-minute video which is excellent at getting me started on the right foot into sha stuffs. It covers some of the basics knowledge, like the requirements for a hash algorithm, in what kind of scenarios would it be needed, etc.

2. [How Secure is 256 Bit Security?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9JGmA5_unY&t=173s)

   First of all, that is a very catchy title, I must say (at least for me ._.). It doesn't just throw the statistics and huge numbers to your face, but it actually tries to reimagine those huge numbers in a more concrete, imaginable way. 2^256 imagined in 4 billion of Google++ sized servers * 4 billions earth * 4 billions Milky Way and so much more!

3. [The Imitation Game](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/)

   I can't just leave out this fine movie while talking about cryptography. This movie follows the infamous Alan Turing as he and a selected few other personnels race against time trying to crack the German Enigma code during World War II. I initially thought the movie might be boring, but turns out it's far from that. It focuses not only on the technical stuffs, but also the challenges (mainly social) that occured alongside his endeavor. Have a watch of this movie and perhaps you'll suddenly feel the urge to crack some code too :v

4. [Braingle >> Cryptography Brain Teasers](https://www.braingle.com/brainteasers/Cryptography.html)
   
   I remember playing around in this website quite a lot back in high school, trying to solve the problems because I thought the idea of code deciphering is fun. I was only able to solve the ones that use Caesar cipher (using a hint, on top of that).

5. [Cryptography: Crash Course Somputer Science #33](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7)
   
   I love Crash Course videos. They explain things in a simple and concise way, and even better, they're illustrated (I learn better through visuals, so there's that). This Crash Course video covers basic ideas about cryptography with some of its history too. Another thing that I like about this particular video is that it explains how the Enigma machine works in a very simplified way, enough for me to get the gist of it and a sense of how complicated it actually is.

6. [Hackers & Cyber Attacks: Crash Course Computer Science #32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GzE99AmAQU&t=239s)
   
   Another Crash Course video (cause as I stated before, I love crash course videos)! This one's about hackers and cyber attacks. It covers phishing, pretexting, trojan horse, ransomware, etc. + how they are carried out.

7. [Hacker Explains One Concept in 5 Levels of Difficulty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9PqVcgT1kQ&t=27s)

   As the title stated, in this video, a hacker tries to explain the concept of hacking in 5 levels of difficulty: 
     1. A child
     2. A teen
     3. College student
     4. Grad student
     5. Expert
   
   In my opinion, this video is pretty good in getting me to know more about hacking in general, because it goes from the most basic concepts (level 1) up to the more complex and detailed ones (level 5), so I can reconfirm what I already know and (hopefully) grasp in the ones I haven't.

8. [C Programming Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NWeucMKrLI&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAKIXv8Yr6nhGJ9Vlcjyymq)

   This is a YouTube playlist covering tutorials on programming with C. Last year, I learned Spring Boot using this channel's Spring Boot tutorials playlist and it was awesome. One particular thing I like from this channel's tutorials is that the tutorials are segmented in such a way that each video's duration is not too long, ranging approximately from 3 to 12 minutes long (which is just right for my short attention span :v), yet the materials are delivered crystal clear.

9. [Why C is so Influential](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ci1PJexnfNE&t=17s)

   Another video from Computerphile. When this video popped up in my YouTube search results, I'm actually quite surprised at how it never crossed my mind to find the answer to this question yet I am actually super curious about it. As the title stated, this video talked about why the classic C language is so important and influential.

10. [Targeted Attack: The Game](http://targetedattacks.trendmicro.com/)

    This is an interactive game on cyber security. The game puts us as the CIO of a global organization called "The Fugle". We will be asked to make choices on several cyber security problems regarding the organization.
