# Top 10 List of Week 08

1. [Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DhFmL-6SDA)

    As the title suggests, this video covers topics on preemptive and nonpreemptive scheduling. It starts with brief explanation about CPU scheduler and dispatcher, and from there they slowly ease into the topics about preemptive and nonpreemptive scheduling. I've been stating that I love this channel for quite some time, so there's that. But aside of that, in this particular video, I love how they cover the important terms and background first to make sure we get sufficient base knowledge to get into the main topic. Also, don't be surprised to find several other videos to this channel down the list, this channel is pure gold.

2. [Scheduling Criteria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWHFY8-rL5I)

    Before getting into different scheduling algorithms, it is essential for us to know about what makes them difference in the first place, by what criteria and basis they are compared to each other. This video covers those criterias: CPU utilization, throughput, turnaround time, waiting time, and response time. It not only mentions them, but it goes through and explains each one of them in details, which is super helpful in getting me to understand them better.

3. [Scheduling Algorithms - First Come First Served (FCFS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DoP1L9nAAs)

    After tackling the basics and background of scheduling in the videos listed on previous numbers prior to this, this video serves as the starting point into each individual scheduling algorithms. This first one covers about First Come First Served (FCFS) algorithm. In the attempt of doing so, it gives many illustrations which are very intuitive and easy to understand, one of which is in the form of several people lining up on a queue. Beside that, the video also provided explanation in the form of widely used tables and Gantt charts, which comes off to be very useful.

4. [First Come First Served Scheduling (Solved Problem)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSMAjMfJ6KQ)

    Having explained the First Come First Served (FCFS) algorithm in the video on the previous number, this video provides a practice problem, complete with its solution. In solving the problem, it walks through the steps one by one, explaining what each step does, how they work, and why they are done the way they are done in details to ensure we won't get lost somewhere in the middle of the solving. There's also another practice problem video of this FCFS algorithm on this channel, you can check it out if you want.

5. [Scheduling Algorithms - Shortest Job First (SJF)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0g9b3SJECg)

    As part of the scheduling algorithms video, this one explains about Shortest Job First (SJF) algorithm. In it are covered both preemptive and nonpreemptive SJF algorithms, accompanied by the average waiting time calculation of both algorithms. Aside of that, it also covers about the problems that could arise from the usage of the SJF algorithms, and also, the different approaches to deal with those problems. Just looking at the list of topics covered in this video, it is fairly obvious this video is a very comprehensive one and would surely come in handy in the process of learning the SJF algorithm.

6. [Scheduling Algorithms - Priority Scheduling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKD3pcFvGmY)

    This video explains about another scheduling algorithm, the priority scheduling algorithm. The video starts off with the definition of priority scheduling algorithm in general. It then proceeds to the technical parts like how it works and the calculation of its average waiting time. Then the video goes on to mention the problems that are associated with priority scheduling algorithm and the solutions to those problems.

7. [Scheduling Algorithms - Round Robin Scheduling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzBBJYfwdi8)

    Still in the scheduling algorithm series, this video explains about one of the scheduling algorithms, the Round Robin scheduling algorithm. It starts with the general idea of Round Robin algorithm, then proceeds to the deeper explanation abot how it works and how it is imlpemented. In the implementation part, a step by step walkthrough is also included, which ensures better understanding of the algorithm implememtation of the viewers.

8. [Multilevel Queue Scheduling Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvkSXMZaBNY)

    This video covers Multilevel Queue (MLQ) scheduling algorithm. The video starts with a sample hypothetical situation where MLQ algorithm is needed: what's the problem we're facing and how does MLQ algorithm offer a solution to this particular problem. Then after this example, it goes on to explain the algorithm: what kind of algorithm it is, how it works, and also an example of it with multilevel queue listed in the order of priority.

9. [Multilevel Feedback-Queue Scheduling Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KLuC0knvs8)

    Last but not least on the series, there's Multilevel Feedback-Queue (MLFQ) scheduling algorithm. This algorithm has a very similar name to the algorithm in the previous number, the Multilevel Queue Scheduling (MLQ) algorithm, but they aren't necessarily the same. Knowing that, this video starts off with the difference between the two, which I think is good because I can get the confusion out of the way early from the start, thus resulting in a better comprehension throughout the rest of the video.

10. [Scheduling Algorithms â€“ Solved Problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6QjVDyGgSE)

    This, I think, is the perfect tool to mark the end of this list. This video combines every scheduling algorithms in several problems to be solved. After having learned numerous different scheduling algorithms each by themselves, we might want to know how they relate to each other. Me personally, I love this idea cause sometimes when I learn something like this, I can solve problems regarding each one of them just fine, but when they're combined together, the confusion kicks in. Even if you can't relate to that, this could still serve as a nice review and might help you recall what you've learnt previously.
