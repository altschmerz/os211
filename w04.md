# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [Essentials: Pointer Power!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5NszbIerYc)<br>

   This is another video from Computerphile. I got the gist that it's gonna good when 5 minutes into it, they start illustrating pointer concepts in linked list using lego pieces.

2. [Pointers in C / C++ [Full Course]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuegQmMdy8M)<br>

   freeCodeCamp was one of the first sites I got introduced to when I first learnt programming. Having used it for quite some time now, they're definitely a huge help. This is a 3-hour video they made on pointers; what more could one ask for?

3. [Basics of Dynamic Memory Allocation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udfbq4M2Kfc)<br>

   So when I was learning latches and flip flops in Digital Systems course last year, I came across this channel called Neso Academy, and it is one of the major reasons I passed that course. In this video, they explain about static memory allocation, its example, and what problems may arise with its usage. Then they proceed to explain about dynamic memory allocation and the use of pointer in it.

4. [Dynamic Memory Allocation using malloc()](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4)<br>

   This video is a continuation of the video in number 3 above. In this one, they cover dynamic memory allocation using malloc() function. I've tried building a simple program in C before, but got stuck because I couldn't seem to comprehend this malloc() function, so I guess it's time for me to tackle that malloc() function now.

5. [Dynamic memory allocation in C - malloc calloc realloc free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDVC3wKjS64)<br>

   So after tackling the malloc() function in the previous video, this video covers the difference between malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), and free(). I used to visit this channel for help in explaining data structures; they explain everything thoroughly and the explanations are very in-depth.

6. [Comparing C to machine language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOyaJXpAYZQ)<br>

   This video (although I'm not sure if it's related to this week's material) is so intriguing that I just can't leave it out. This video compares a simple C program with the compiled machine code of the same program side by side. I had so many "AHA moments" during this video; it's simply mindblowing.

7. [Static vs. Shared Libraries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vp9cFQCQCo)<br>

   This is a short video explaining the difference between static and shared libraries. The explanation is very simple and delivered in a very intuitive way, thus highly suitable for beginners in the topic like me.

8. [Big Endian vs Little Endian.mp4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrNF0KRAlyo)<br>

   I gotta admit I was lured into this video by its title (I can't unsee the mp4 extension in the title, I mean who puts the extension on the title?). But then turns out it's a video from 2011, but its content is still pretty much relevant. The explanations are concise, too, a nice bonus to it.

9. [Endianness Explained With an Egg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcaiHcBvDR4)<br>

   I gotta admit that is a very catchy title (at least to me). I never knew endianness can be explained with, out of all other things in this world, an egg. It just sounds super interesting to me. If I've watched this video earlier, perhaps I would've been able to answer the pop quiz issued this morning .-.

10. [C Programming: Makefiles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GExnnTaBELk)<br>

    First of all, the video is honestly quite daunting for me (it's a video about makefile, and it's 45 minutes long!). But in the very beginning of the video, it's stated that it's for beginners, so that was what convinced me to watch it. It's a very helpful video, it covers the makefile in a very in-depth way, and illustrates things to make them easier to understand.
