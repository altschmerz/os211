# Top 10 List of Week 06

1. [Process Management (Processes and Threads)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrM7nZcxXZU)

    Another video from Neso Academy. I watched this while preparing for my Advanced Programming midterm exam a while ago, which involved a tad bit of concurrency topic. Can confirm that this video has been very helpful. It covers the basic definitions of process management, process, threads, and how they are related to one another. Aside of that, it also explains the difference between thread and processes (which I find very useful because I had a hard time differentiating the two in the beginning).

2. [Introduction to Threads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOfGJcVnvAk)

    Yep, and yet another video from Neso Academy. Ain't kidding when I said I owe my academic grades to this channel, so don't be surprised to find several other videos from this channel down the list. After covering processes and threads in the previous video, this one starts by reviewing the definition of thread first, then proceeds to single-threaded and multi-threaded processes. It also explains the benefits of multi-threaded programming near the end.

3. [Concurrency, Threading and Parallelism Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olYdb0DdGtM)

    This is also one of the videos I watched when I was preparing for the Advanced Programming test a while ago. Aside of stating the plain definition of each term, this video also explains how each of them works and gives a visualization of the process. The words used to explain are also simple and easy to understand even though this is quite a technical topic, which serves as a plus point.

4. [Concurrency vs Parallelism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FChZP09Ba4E)

    As the title suggests, this video explains specifically about the difference between concurrency and parallelism. What I love about this video is that it has loads of examples and illustrations (like code samples and diagrams) to help support his explanation and thus makes it easier to grasp.

5. [Data/Task Parallelism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3C0N4rBLNDk)

    I gotta admit that the reason I clicked on this video in the first place is because of its meme-like thumbnail. Watched the video and got a chuckle out of it. It explains concurrency, data parallelism, and task paralellism with the example of two people shoveling snow. Aside of entertaining, I find the video to be surprisingly informational too. The way of narrating combined with the facial expressions of the actors is just top notch /*chef kiss*/.

6. [Amdahl's Law Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViMI_ciiC2A)

    Upon encountering Amdahl's Law, I figured I need to see some examples to better incorporate the idea. So I searched for it, and this video was what I found. I think this video did a very good job in explaining it, judging by the way the explanation was laid out step by step, thus making it easier to understand and follow. The example problem is also quite simple, not too complicated, which is just perfect for amateurs in the subject like me.

7. [Operating Systems: Threads](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/4_Threads.html)

    This site provides course notes which are extracted from the "Operating System Concepts" book by Silberchatz. This particular one is about threads. It lists out important subtopics from the threads topic and includes the important points of each subtopic. I think this will be an excellent resource to review what I've learned and check if there's anything I missed.

8. [Multithreading Models & Hyperthreading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW2Wcx-ktsc)

    This yet another video from Neso Academy explains about multithreading models, like many-to-one model, one-to-one model, and many-to-many model. The video also includes brief explanation about types of threads to set the base for the multithreading models and closes with explanation of hyperthreading.

9. [Threading Issues (fork() and exec() System Calls)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2Sf0GHWpmk)

    This video covers threading issues, specifically those related to fork() and exec() system calls. Alongside that, it also chip in explanations regarding two versions of the fork and which version of the fork to be used at certain scenarios.

10. [Threading Issues (Thread Cancellation)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNns0kIDC68)

    As the video on the previous number revolves around the topic of threading issues related to fork() and exec() system calls, this one's about another type of threading issues: threading cancellation. It provides information about what the problem is, different ways in which a thread can be cancelled, and examples of thread cancellation.
