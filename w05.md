# Top 10 List of Week 05

1. [Memory Hierarchy Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kZY4orPQW0)

    So actually, we've learned bits of memory hierarchy back in the Computer Organization course, but I figure I need some refreshing on the topic and this is just the video for it. The video starts off with some background as to why memory hierarchy is ever needed in the first place, which I think is a perfect opener to slowly ease us off into the actual memory hierarchy explanation.

2. [Virtual Memory: 3 What is Virtual Memory?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlH4-oHnBb8)

    "Any problem in computer science can be solved by adding indirection." This is the line that caught my attention immediately a minute into the video. From the start, the video had been stating that virtual memory is all about indirection, and proceeded to strengthen it with that line. Then, it explained about this indirection by giving an illustration of comparison between mapping before and after using virtual memory, and all the pieces just fell right into their place.

3. [Copy-On-Write Fork](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViUwLytKzTY)

    This video begins with normal fork, what problems may arise with that approach, and how copy-on-write solves that problem with optimization. Each and every step of the explanation is illustrated, which to a visual learner like me, is gold. It helps me so much in grasping and actually understanding the details of the explanation.

4. [Segmented, Paged and Virtual Memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9yZNLeOj4s)

    As the title suggested, this is a 7 minute video covering segmented, paged, and virtual memory. Each part is explained with illustrations, with its point characteristics reviewed after the explanation. As the video is only 7 minutes long, the content is more like an overview, but they're still very insightful.

5. [Virtual Memory - Demand Paging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOVrEbZVeoU)

    This video explains demand paging with a hypotethical situation or case, accompanied with illustrations. The illustrations make the explanation much more intuitive and easy to grasp.

6. [Demand paging | Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOz3YMfEo1o&t=72s)

    Another video on demand paging, this one explains demand paging with the formal format, with definitions, examples, etc. Together with the video from the previous number, this video helped me to finally understand demand paging.

7. [Demand Paging | Performance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7)

    This video is actually a continuation of the previous video on demand paging. After some introductory explanation about demand paging in the previous video, this one covers the performance of demand paging and how to calculate it. 

8. [Paging & Page Replacement Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ6qrCB8pDw&list=PLIY8eNdw5tW-BxRY0yK3fYTYVqytw8qhp)

    There are quite a lot of page replacement algorithms, so instead of looking around for each one of it, I found this playlist. This playlist not only cover each page replacement algorithms, but also contains some videos comparing several page replacement algorithms side-to-side, which I personally think helped the information to stick better and longer.

9. [What is Non Uniform Memory Access?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmb8xGD-LV8)

    Not gonna lie, when I first encountered this term Non-Uniform Memory Access, I was pretty much daunted. I thought this was gonna be some complicated concept, judging from the fancy name it has. But turns out, this video helped me tackle the basics of the concept in 6 minutes, which is pure gold.

10. [What is thrashing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIJIDC-u8JU)

    Wrapping up, here's a video on thrashing. The first 3 minutes are spent on solidifying the concept of thrashing. It then proceeds to show some case examples of thrashing alongside with some illustrations.
